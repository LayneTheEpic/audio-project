const beatDetectionVersion = "1.0.3";



// majority of the beat detection code is "borrowed" from https://github.com/chrisguttandin/web-audio-beat-detector-worker
// "borrowed" because while the idea of loud points --> intervals --> buckets is ripped, I did rewrite a fair amount of it from scratch
